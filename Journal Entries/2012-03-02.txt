Entry 6:

1.  Covered for this entry:

For this entry I have covered Chapter F in Mastering Dyalog APL (pg 273-291).
Chapter F covers the Execute function and the various ways to format data
in Dyalog.

Additionally, I have also now completed problems 4,5, and 6 on Project Euler.

2.  What I found interesting:

I found it interesting that Dyalog APL had so many methods to format and
encode data.  I didn't know that there were was a function that could
manipulate the column width of matrices and a system to format numbers
to make them more visually appealing.

3. Difficulties:

I found the section on the ⎕FMT System Function to be a little difficult.
I understand what it does and how it is used, but there is a lot of complexity
to it with all of the different specifications and their qualifiers and
affixtures.  This portion of the chapter was a little overwhelming, and I could
definitely not repeat portions of it from memory.  Used as a reference,
howeverm I believe that I could work with ⎕FMT.

4. What I Found Easy:

The Execute function is pretty simple and I had no problems with it.  In fact,
I used it in my solution for Project Euler Problem 4 before I had even read
Chapter F because its appearance seemed to imply that it would unformat my
formatted numbers.

5. Impressions:

The section regarding the ⎕FMT System Function reminded me a little bit of the
RegEx in Java.

6. Dislikes:

I had no dislikes in particular.


7. Code:
Here is the code that I have written for problems 4, 5, and 6 on Project Euler.

--------------------------------
Problem 4:
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

 res←palindrome;x;y;res
 x←999
 y←999
 res←⍬

 :While (x>99)

     :While (y>99)
         :If ((⍎⍕x×y)=(⍎⌽⍕x×y))
             res←res,x×y

         :EndIf
         y←y-1

     :EndWhile
     x←x-1
     y←999
 :EndWhile
 ⌈/res

--------------------------------

Problem 5:
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly 
divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

 m←problem5 n;m;i
 m←1
 i←2

 :While (i<n)
     m←m∧i
     i←i+1
 :EndWhile

problem5 20

--------------------------------

Problem 6:
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the 
first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

((+/(⍳100))*2)-(+/((⍳100)*2))
