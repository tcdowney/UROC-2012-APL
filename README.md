IU UROC 2012 - Dyalog APL Project
=============

NAS Parallel Benchmarks
----------------
For our research project, my partner Brett Schrank and I studied Dyalog APL and worked with our graduate mentor [Aaron Hsu](https://github.com/arcfide) to translate three of the [NAS Parallel Benchmarks](http://www.nas.nasa.gov/publications/npb.html) (Integer Sort, Conjugant Gradient, and Embarassingly Parallel) from C and FORTRAN into APL.

Our implementations of these benchmarks can be found in `benchmarks.tex` in the `NAS Parallel Benchmarks` folder.  To help others make sense of the relatively foreign looking code, Aaron has packaged everything as a nice tex document that is meant to be executed with his [ConTeXtLP](https://github.com/arcfide/ConTeXtLP) literate programming system.

Additionally, Brett and I wrote up an explanation of the code in our final report, which can be found in the root of the repository in the file `report.tex`.

These benchmarks will be used to test Aaron's upcoming HPAPL parallel programming language.

Learning APL
------------------
For Brett and I, the main purpose of this project was to evaluate an "unusual" programming language and determine what challenges a novice programmer might face while learning it.  To do this, we each wrote a series of journal entries (my entries can be found in the `Journal Entries` folder) as we worked through the [Mastering Dyalog APL](http://www.dyalog.com/MasteringDyalogAPL/MasteringDyalogAPL.pdf) text.  Additionally, we completed a handful of [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems to help put what we had been learning into practice.

Brett and I then made a poster of our findings and presented it at the UROC poster session.  The poster is also located in the repository root as `poster.png`.
