Entry 5:

1.  Covered for this entry:

For this entry I have covered Chapter E in Mastering Dyalog (pg 239-265)
and I have completed the first three problems on Project Euler and am
well on my way into finishing the fourth.

2.  What I found interesting:

I didn't find Chapter E particularly interesting.  While tracing and debugging
is certainly important to know, it isn't exactly a very novel or interesting
topic.  However, the chapter was refreshingly short and I have no complaints
in that regard!

What I did find interesting was Project Euler.  Project Euler has always been
one of those things that I have heard about and meant to try, but have never
actually gotten around to doing.  Working the first four problems, however,
was definitely entertaining and, in my opinion, a lot more engaging than the
exercises in the book.  I think the social aspect of Project Euler was
definitely a motivating factor for me.

3. Difficulties:

Again, there wasn't anything that was particularly difficult to understand
in this chapter.  I did have some difficulties with Project Euler, however.
I found that I spent quite a bit of time looking up symbols to be able to
complete the problems, but I think it was definitely worth it.  Additionally,
I had some trouble thinking in the single-line APL mindset and found myself
turning to using manual while loops.  For all I know these while loops may
have been necessary, but I probably could have completed some of the problems
more concisely.

4. What I Found Easy:

I found the chapter fairly easy in general.  I experienced many of the error
dialogues first hand while trying to answer some of the problems and I thought
it was pretty intuitive.

5. Impressions:

It was nice to be able to apply some of my APL knowledge and test myself to see
what I have truly learned.  I think Project Euler is an excellent tool for
learning a new language.

6. Dislikes:

I had no dislikes.


7. Code:

Here is the code that I've written so far for project Euler.
Problem 4 is still a work in progress for me, but here is the
code that I've written so far for it.

Project Euler:

Problem 1:
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

	
	nats ← ⍳999
	+/ ((((3|nats) = 0) ∨ ((5|nats) = 0))/nats)

	Answer: 233168

--------------------------------

Problem 2:
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values 
do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

	Fib Function:

	res←fib;int;res;seq
 	int←3
 	res←0 1
 	:Repeat
    		res←res,(res[int-2]+res[int-1])
     		int←int+1
 	:Until (4000000≤res[int-1])
 	res←res[⍳int-2]

	Addition of Evens:

	+/ ((2 | fib) = 0) / fib

	Answer: 4613732

--------------------------------

Problem 3:
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

	Prime Factorization Function:

	res←primetime n;n;res;i
 	i←2
 	res←⍬

	:While i≤n

		:While ((i|n)=0)
     			res←res,i
         		n←n÷i
		:EndWhile

     		i←i+1
 	:EndWhile



	⌈/primetime 600851475143

	
	Answer: 6857

--------------------------------

Problem 4:
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

	Palindrome Function:

res←palindrome;x;y;res
 x←999
 y←999

 :While ((x>99)∧((⍎⍕x×y)≠(⍎⌽⍕x×y)))

     :While ((y>99)∧((⍎⍕x×y)≠(⍎⌽⍕x×y)))
        ⍝ :If ((⍎⍕x×y)=(⍎⌽⍕x×y))
        ⍝     res←x×y
        ⍝     :Leave
     ⍝:EndIf
         y←y-1
     :EndWhile
     x←x-1
 :EndWhile
 res←x×y
